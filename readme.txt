Footy prediction algorithm.

MakeFootyHistory - downloads latest football historical data from www.football-data.co.uk. This needs to be run first before any analysis can be done. Once this has been run the AnalyseFixtures script can be run.
AnalyseFixtures - downloads the latest fixture list from www.football-data.co.uk and applies the historical data generated by MakeFootyHistory and creates predictions based on the selected 'model'. Output is placed in the 'analysisDir'. -s option will send an email of the predictions to the 'toAddrs' distribution.
FootyBacktest - can be used to run backtest of the selected model over the historical data, it also specficies the leagues and ranges to be used in both back test and full operational mode ('rangeMap').
DownloadData - can be used to download the raw historical data from www.football-data.co.uk.
Logging - this module defines a simple log functionality that can be switched on and off via command line args.
