Footy prediction algorithm.

MakeFootyHistory - downloads latest football historical data from www.football-data.co.uk. This script runs the historical analysis and generates the summary statistics for each league in the rangeMap specified in thse ini file (see later). This must be run before running AnalyseFixtures or FootyBackTest.
AnalyseFixtures - downloads the latest fixture list from www.football-data.co.uk it uses the same historical data generated by MakeFootyHistory and creates predictions based on the selected 'model'. Output is placed in the 'analysisDir'. Running with -s option will send an email of the predictions to the addresses specified in file named footy.ini (not included in repo, however you will find example.footy.ini from which can be used as a template).
FootyBacktest - can be used to run backtest of the selected model over the historical data specified in the rangeMap (see .ini).
FootyAnalysisTools - defines the models and the analysis output directory.
DownloadData - can be used to download the raw historical data from www.football-data.co.uk.
Logging - this module defines a simple log functionality that can be switched on and off via command line args.
example.footy.ini - a template footy.ini file that contains the mail and algo configuration parameters. Modify the mail parameters to specify an appropriate mail sever and distribution list. Modify the algo parameters to specify which leagues you wish to run the algos over and what marks to use for prediction, also allows for configuration of the number of seasons to be included in analysis.
